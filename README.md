Udemy Python excercises for beginners

Having developped a better understanding of Python, still a lot to learn, but I like to learn by doing.

Finished the course

TL;DR
4/5 stars
Would recommend as a beginner course, but has some rough edges.

Bought this course as a sort of puzzlebook and testing where i'm at with Python programming.
I've been a programmer before, decided for myself i'm not a good one, but Python does scratch some itch.
Also gravitating towards more data-related work. 

But back to the course, i'm probably not the target audience.

The good:
Wide variety of topics
Lots of references towards background info and interesting algorithems
Explanations of the solutions are very thorough
You need to do your own research (and come accross al sorts of interesting related topics)
    (which mimics day to day software development, Google and Stackoverflow for the win)
Especially some of the later topics are challenging and requirers to think thouroughly 

The lesser:
I prefer a more structured way of teaching, there is a fine line between 
    complete handholding vs do your own research.
If some innerfunctions are explained or refered to, you would expect when
    the occasion arises, make use of those inner functions(, but maybe that's me?)
A couple of instances of 'laziness'/too easy, one excercise do 'max', the next do 'min'
    (but again this is counterbalanced with the same amount of realy interesting challenges?)

Overall:
Enjoyable, learned a lot about Python in general during this course.
Eyeopening on some parts especially regarding my own flaws (Often I think way too dificult)
