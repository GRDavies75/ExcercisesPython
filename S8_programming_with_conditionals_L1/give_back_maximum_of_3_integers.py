"""
Excercise 8-48 
Give back the maximum of 3 integers

Have mixed feelings about this one.
This should be about conditionals, but in the example it is shown as a tuple
Which is I believe a iterable and there is also the max() build in function...
...
In the spirit of the excercise probably an 2 layered if then else?
UPDATE: sort of: if a > b and a > c elif same for b else c. ... 
within the excercise would be acceptable, but definitly not scalable...
UPDATE2: in the solution there is also refered to the max() function
