Excercise 9-54
Given are quadratic equations (ax**2 + bx + c = 0)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation

To solve such equations:
x = (-b + root(b**2 - 4ac))/2a or x = (-b - root(b**2 - 4ac))/2a
Note: the 'b**2 - 4ac' part is called the Discriminant

Solutions are/have:
2 solutions, print the negative one first
1 solution, Dicrimant == 0, print x
'no solution' aka Discriminant < 0 and solves only when making use
of i (imaginary numbers) because of rooting negative numbers

Personal note: 
I'm a numberphile, but not a mathematician persÃ©
Where or when to use quadratic equations?
- If given a finite amount of Materials (square foot/cm/whatever, x in the same measurement)
    and given known desired Ratio (length (x) vs width (?x))
    determine x => Rx**2 + 0x <= M, normalized to Rx**2 - M = 0 (a = R, b = 0, c = -M)
- For all the scholars, know the solution(s) and you know where the graph 
    of the quadratic equation intersects the x-as (aka y == 0) 
    if any, in case of the Discrimant < 0

Enough theory, back to the excercise
