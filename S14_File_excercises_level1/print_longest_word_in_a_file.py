"""
Excercise 14-87
Find and print the longest word in a file
Originally:
You may assume 1 word per line

But where is the fun in that?
My version of this excercise:
Google a decent sentences containing file
For simplicification a 'word' is:
    encapsulated in spaces (or beginning (^) or end ($) of line)
    only contains letters (.isalpha() == True)

print:
line number
position (index of word, base-1 instead of base-0)
word length
the word itself
(In case of a tie, print the first word, but also print the number of ties)
